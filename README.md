# TRS on Steroids – AI-Enhanced Ticket Response Automation

**TRS on Steroids** is a powerful browser extension built to automate and accelerate ticket response workflows within the **SAP AMS support portal at The Config Team**. By combining real-time data extraction with AI-driven content generation, the extension creates accurate, consistent, and professional internal comments—minimizing manual effort and boosting productivity.

The extension continuously monitors ticket pages, capturing key information such as requester details, contact timelines, recent communications, and support effort metrics. This data is used to dynamically populate intelligent response templates that adapt to each ticket's unique context. With support for multi-stage follow-ups, escalations, and closure procedures, TRS on Steroids ensures communication stays compliant with business policies while drastically reducing repetitive work.

The result? A streamlined, one-click response workflow that keeps support interactions fast, consistent, and error-free.

## How It Works

1. **Install the extension** and grant access to the designated SAP AMS support portal URLs.  
2. **Open a ticket page**—the extension automatically begins monitoring relevant fields and content.  
3. When writing a response, the extension **extracts up-to-date ticket information**, including requester name, latest customer comments, and effort tracking data.  
4. It then provides **context-aware, AI-enhanced templates** pre-filled with extracted details.  
5. **Select the appropriate template** for the communication stage (e.g., follow-up, warning, closure).  
6. **Adjust the generated text** if needed, then send your customer reply or internal note.  
7. The extension continues to **update template content dynamically** as the ticket evolves.
